# Wallpaper Randomizer
A Python script that will download a random Desktop wallpaper from Unsplash and set it as your wallpaper. Works on Windows, not tested on Linux or macOS.

## How to use?
1. Create a developer app in Unsplash and get your Client ID.
2. Set this client ID in the `CLIENT_ID` variable in the script.
3. (optional) Set the script to run on startup. Just search "startup apps" in Windows and it should be pretty straightforward.
4. Enjoy!
